# lyriqs.io - Client

This is the client side project for `lyriqs.io` - my mashup for the first assignment of the QUT course *CAB432 Cloud Computing*.

## Description
TODO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## APIs
TODO

## How to use
Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

You can also create a Docker image and start up a container with the following commands: 
```
docker build -t meder96/lyriqs-client .
docker run -p 8080:80 meder96/lyriqs-client
```
The client application will then be available at `http://localhost:8080/`.
